Raqqa Army units in cooperation with the popular defense groups have advanced in Raqqa countryside inflicting losses upon the ranks of ISIS terrorists whose positions have received direct strikes. After establishing control over the oil pumping station and electricity station of al-Tabqa city in addition to two oil fields in the western countryside of Raqqa the army has continued advancing and swiftly established control over areas where ISIS terrorists spread in Harbiyat and Anbaj villages a military source told SANA on Saturday. Having advanced that far the army units are now only 6 km from al-Rasafa area after they have already secured a 57 km long area extending between Atherya near Hama and al-Rasafeh in the eastern Badiya (desert) the source said. It added that al-Safih Triangle that is located near al-Habbari field has now been under the armys full control after the remaining gatherings of ISIS terrorists were eliminated before the rest fled the area. A drone for ISIS terrorists was shot down while it was trying to monitor the armys movement towards the eastern Badiya to hinder its advance the source noted. Deir Ezzor Units of the army and armed forces killed 15 ISIS terrorists and injured others in al-Reshdia neighborhood vicinity of al-Tharda mount and Ayash villge in the Deir Ezzor city and its countryside during the last hours a field source told SANA reporter.

Daraa Army units carried out military operations against Jabhat al-Nusra terrorists in the southern Daraa province destroying some of their fortifications and gatherings to the south of al-Kark roundabout in Daraa al-Mahatta neighborhood and to the south of al-Menshiyeh neighborhood in Daraa al-Balad area. The source added that another army unit clashed with a Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist group that attempted to infiltrate into the vicinity of a military post in Daraa al-Mahatta killing or injuring most of the groups members. English Bulletin\",\n          \"Published April 2 2017 Syrian opposition forces on Sunday claimed that Russian jets in violation of a cease-fire hit an outpost in northwestern Syrias Idlib province near the border with Turkey killing at least one opposition fighter and wounding several others. They said several overnight raids hit Babeska a village in Idlib that has become a haven for several moderate Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups. A tripartite mechanism was established in February by Turkey Russia and Iran to monitor the ceasefire in Syria. Opposition forces however say Russia has failed to pressure the Assad regime to ensure the ceasefire holds. The village also houses hundreds of families and fighters from the Damascus suburb of Daraya which fell to Assad regime forces last year and was evacuated by opposition forces. Fighter jets also believed to be Russian struck the town of Urum al Kubra in the opposition-held western Aleppo countryside where five civilians were killed in an area that has witnessed fighting between the opposition and the Assad regime the opposition said.\",\n          \"Syria air strikes kill dozens in rebel town Monitor AFP Wednesday 17 Sep 2014 Syrian air strikes on a besieged rebel town in the heart of the country have killed nearly 50 people over the past two days a monitoring group said on Wednesday. \\\"On Tuesday 25 people including seven women and a child were killed in air strikes on Talbisseh in Homs province\\\" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said adding that a rebel commander was also among the dead. On Monday air strikes killed 23 people in the town which has been under siege by the army ever since rebels seized it two year ago. Activists appealed for help on Facebook. \\\"The towns hospital has received a large number of wounded patients. The hospital has no more medicines or bandages\\\" said one activist from Talbisseh. A security source in Damascus confirmed the air strikes. \\\"There are a large number of armed terrorist groups. On Tuesday Talbissehs most important terrorist and his brother were killed\\\" the source said using the regimes standard term for the rebels. He identified the dead commander as Abu Hatem al-Dahik head of the rebel Al-Iman Brigade. \\\"We will continue to target the terrorists in all their hideouts\\\" the source told AFP on condition of anonymity. The Observatory said that rebels in Talbisseh had shelled regime positions around the nearby rebel-held town of Umm Sharshuh as fighting raged around it. The towns are among a number that the rebels still hold in Homs province after their withdrawal from Homs city earlier year. The Observatory meanwhile updated to 18 its toll for the number of rebels killed in an abortive attempt to infiltrate the heart of Damascus on Monday. Two pro-regime militiamen were also killed. One person was killed in central Damascus on Wednesday by rebel fire from its outskirts the state SANA news agency reported. Some 191000 people have been killed since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assads rule erupted in March 2011.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"etilaf\",\n          \"arabiya\",\n          \"nna\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 423,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"8/17/2014\",\n          \"5/2/2016\",\n          \"6/23/2014\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"location\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"daraa\",\n          \"quneitra\",\n          \"idlib\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Army units have killed many ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra terrorists as they continued their operations against the two organizations positions in various areas. Raqqa Army units in cooperation with the popular defense groups have advanced in Raqqa countryside inflicting losses upon the ranks of ISIS terrorists whose positions have received direct strikes. After establishing control over the oil pumping station and electricity station of al-Tabqa city in addition to two oil fields in the western countryside of Raqqa the army has continued advancing and swiftly established control over areas where ISIS terrorists spread in Harbiyat and Anbaj villages a military source told SANA on Saturday. Having advanced that far the army units are now only 6 km from al-Rasafa area after they have already secured a 57 km long area extending between Atherya near Hama and al-Rasafeh in the eastern Badiya (desert) the source said. It added that al-Safih Triangle that is located near al-Habbari field has now been under the armys full control after the remaining gatherings of ISIS terrorists were eliminated before the rest fled the area. A drone for ISIS terrorists was shot down while it was trying to monitor the armys movement towards the eastern Badiya to hinder its advance the source noted. Deir Ezzor Units of the army and armed forces killed 15 ISIS terrorists and injured others in al-Reshdia neighborhood vicinity of al-Tharda mount and Ayash villge in the Deir Ezzor city and its countryside during the last hours a field source told SANA reporter. The source added that an army unit destroyed an ammunition and weapons-loaded vehicle for ISIS at the vicinity of Tharda mount at the southern side of the city. Tens of ISIS terrorists including foreigners were killed in the last few days in several areas of Deir Ezzor province by army units which also destroyed a number of ISIS heavy machine gun-equipped vehicles. Daraa Army units carried out military operations against Jabhat al-Nusra terrorists in the southern Daraa province destroying some of their fortifications and gatherings to the south of al-Kark roundabout in Daraa al-Mahatta neighborhood and to the south of al-Menshiyeh neighborhood in Daraa al-Balad area. The source added that another army unit clashed with a Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist group that attempted to infiltrate into the vicinity of a military post in Daraa al-Mahatta killing or injuring most of the groups members. English Bulletin\",\n          \"Published April 2 2017 Syrian opposition forces on Sunday claimed that Russian jets in violation of a cease-fire hit an outpost in northwestern Syrias Idlib province near the border with Turkey killing at least one opposition fighter and wounding several others. They said several overnight raids hit Babeska a village in Idlib that has become a haven for several moderate Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups. A tripartite mechanism was established in February by Turkey Russia and Iran to monitor the ceasefire in Syria. Opposition forces however say Russia has failed to pressure the Assad regime to ensure the ceasefire holds. The village also houses hundreds of families and fighters from the Damascus suburb of Daraya which fell to Assad regime forces last year and was evacuated by opposition forces. Fighter jets also believed to be Russian struck the town of Urum al Kubra in the opposition-held western Aleppo countryside where five civilians were killed in an area that has witnessed fighting between the opposition and the Assad regime the opposition said.\",\n          \"Syria air strikes kill dozens in rebel town Monitor AFP Wednesday 17 Sep 2014 Syrian air strikes on a besieged rebel town in the heart of the country have killed nearly 50 people over the past two days a monitoring group said on Wednesday. \\\"On Tuesday 25 people including seven women and a child were killed in air strikes on Talbisseh in Homs province\\\" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said adding that a rebel commander was also among the dead. On Monday air strikes killed 23 people in the town which has been under siege by the army ever since rebels seized it two year ago. Activists appealed for help on Facebook. \\\"The towns hospital has received a large number of wounded patients. The hospital has no more medicines or bandages\\\" said one activist from Talbisseh. A security source in Damascus confirmed the air strikes. \\\"There are a large number of armed terrorist groups. On Tuesday Talbissehs most important terrorist and his brother were killed\\\" the source said using the regimes standard term for the rebels. He identified the dead commander as Abu Hatem al-Dahik head of the rebel Al-Iman Brigade. \\\"We will continue to target the terrorists in all their hideouts\\\" the source told AFP on condition of anonymity. The Observatory said that rebels in Talbisseh had shelled regime positions around the nearby rebel-held town of Umm Sharshuh as fighting raged around it. The towns are among a number that the rebels still hold in Homs province after their withdrawal from Homs city earlier year. The Observatory meanwhile updated to 18 its toll for the number of rebels killed in an abortive attempt to infiltrate the heart of Damascus on Monday. Two pro-regime militiamen were also killed. One person was killed in central Damascus on Wednesday by rebel fire from its outskirts the state SANA news agency reported. Some 191000 people have been killed since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assads rule erupted in March 2011.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"etilaf\",\n          \"arabiya\",\n          \"nna\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 423,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"8/17/2014\",\n          \"5/2/2016\",\n          \"6/23/2014\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"location\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"daraa\",\n          \"quneitra\",\n          \"idlib\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
